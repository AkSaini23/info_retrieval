Cornhill railway station was an intermediate stop situated on the Great North of Scotland Railway (GNoSR) line from Cairnie Junction to Tillynaught. There was only a single platform at Cornhill that served the nearby village that lies in Fordyce Parish, of what was once Banffshire, 8+1‚ÅÑ2 miles (13.7 km) from Banff itself. The line ran to Tillynaught where it split to reach Banff by a branch line or Elgin by the Moray Coast line.
Cornhill was opened in 1859 by the Banff, Portsoy and Strathisla Railway, and in 1867 was absorbed by the GNoSR who took over the line and operated it until grouping in 1923. Passing into British Railways ownership in 1948, the line was, like the rest of the ex-GNoSR lines along the Moray coast, considered for closure as part of the Beeching report and closure notices were issued in 1963.  Passenger and freight services were withdrawn in May 1968.
