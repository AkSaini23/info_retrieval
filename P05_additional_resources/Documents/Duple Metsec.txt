Duple Metsec was a bus bodywork builder based in West Midlands of England in the United Kingdom. It usually supplied body kits for bus assembly overseas.
It was originated from the bus body manufacturing business of Metal Sections, known as TI Metsec in the late 1970s, the present day Voestalpine Metsec plc. Metal Sections, as the name suggests, produced prefabricated sections of metal for customers for a variety of products. In the early days, Metal Sections was not involved in the bus body business, however, after supplying framing sections for other bus body builders, they decided to get into the business themselves.
The business was acquired by Duple Coachbuilders in 1980/1981. Duple Metsec became a subsidiary of Hestair Group in 1983 and then subsidiary of Trinity Holdings in 1989.
When Duple Coachbuilders was closed by Trinity Holdings in 1989, Duple Metsec was not closed and its business was retained. In October 1998, it was acquired by Mayflower Corporation.
The factory of Duple Metsec was closed after the formation of TransBus International in 2001, And after that TransBus International still manufacture DM5000 body until 2002, than the previous Duple Metsec body department is merged with previous Walter Alexander Coachbuilders and Plaxton, which are also acquired by Transbus International, and finally Transbus International remerged into Alexander Dennis since 2004.
