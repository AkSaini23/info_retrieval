Bisnorhopanes (BNH) are a group of demethylated hopanes found in oil shales across the globe and can be used for understanding depositional conditions of the source rock. The most common member, 28,30-bisnorhopane, can be found in high concentrations in petroleum source rocks, most notably the Monterey Shale, as well as in oil and tar samples. 28,30-Bisnorhopane was first identified in samples from the Monterey Shale Formation in 1985. It occurs in abundance throughout the formation and appears in stratigraphically analogous locations along the California coast. Since its identification and analysis, 28,30-bisnorhopane has been discovered in oil shales around the globe, including lacustrine and offshore deposits of Brazil, silicified shales of the Eocene in Gabon, the Kimmeridge Clay Formation in the North Sea, and in Western Australian oil shales.
