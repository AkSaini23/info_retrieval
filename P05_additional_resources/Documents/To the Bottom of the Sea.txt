To the Bottom of the Sea is the sixth studio album by Cuban American dark cabaret singer Voltaire. It was released in 2008, and would be the first album by Voltaire to be released through his then-newly-founded label Mars Needs Music (named after his son, Mars). It is a loose concept album, set in the fictional country of Vorutania.Polish musician Julia Marcell would provide additional vocals for the duet "This Sea"; Voltaire would also cover a song by her, "Accordion Player", originally present in her 2007 EP Storm.
Voltaire's son Mars is among the ones who provided additional vocals for the track "Stakes and Torches (The Uprising of the Peasants)".
Franz Nicolay of The World/Inferno Friendship Society provided the accordions for the album, in his first collaboration with Voltaire.
A music video was made for the track "Happy Birthday (My Olde Friend)"; it would be Voltaire's first (and only so far) music video ever.
