Devian was a Swedish metal band formed by Legion (former singer for Marduk) and Emil in 2006. Originally called Rebel Angels, then Elizium, and finally went to Devian after they found Elizium had been used too many times, and the new name sounded more mysterious and sinister. They released two albums, Ninewinged Serpent in 2007, and God To The Illfated in 2008. Legion left the band in 2010 due to his job as a tattoo artist. After the other members tried and failed to keep Devian alive, they agreed to disband it.
