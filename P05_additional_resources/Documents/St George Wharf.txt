St George Wharf is a riverside development in Vauxhall, Lambeth, London, England, located on the southern bank of the River Thames beside Vauxhall Bridge. St George Wharf Pier is a calling point for London River Services riverboat RB2 and RB6 services.
The 93,000-square-metre (1,000,000 sq ft) mixed-use development is located between the Vauxhall Cross road junction and the river, and is near Vauxhall station. The River Effra, one of the Thames' many underground tributaries, empties into the river close by. This development should not be confused with the smaller St George's Wharf which is in Shad Thames, London SE1, close to Tower Bridge.
