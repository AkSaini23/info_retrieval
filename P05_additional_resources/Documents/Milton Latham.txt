Milton Slocum Latham (May 23, 1827 â€“ March 4, 1882) was an American politician, who served as the sixth governor of California and as a U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator. Latham holds the distinction of having the shortest governorship in California history, lasting for five days between January 9 and January 14, 1860. A Lecompton Democrat, Latham resigned from office (the second governor to do so) after being elected by the legislature to fill the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by the death of Henry P. Haun.
