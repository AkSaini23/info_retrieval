Mason "Dipper" Pines is a fictional character and one of the two lead characters in the Disney Channel animated series Gravity Falls. The character is voiced by Jason Ritter, and is loosely based on the childhood of series creator Alex Hirsch. Dipper appears in all the episodes of Gravity Falls alongside Mabel Pines, his twin sister. Beside his presence in the main series, he appears in the Gravity Falls mini-series titled "Dipper's Guide to the Unexplained" and the shorts "Fixin' it with Soos" and "Mabel's Guide to Life".
Two alternate reality versions of Dipper are featured in Rick and Morty media and Gravity Falls: Lost Legends: Mortipper Pinesâ€“Smith, a composite character of Dipper and Morty Smith, and Mabipper Pines, a combined version of Dipper and Mabel, with the former character featuring in the Rick and Morty episodes "Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind" and "The Ricklantis Mixup", and as a playable character in the video game Pocket Mortys.
