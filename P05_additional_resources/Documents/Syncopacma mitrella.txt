The forewings are bronzy fuscous at the base, darkening to deep brownish fuscous towards the middle, clearly and straightly defined along the inner edge of a white transverse fascia, somewhat expanded outward from the dorsum to the costa. Beyond this the dark brownish fuscous colouring is continued to the apex with bright shining pale steel-grey scales, each tipped with black, radiating outwards along the margins at the base of the brownish grey cilia.
