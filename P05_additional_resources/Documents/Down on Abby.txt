Down on Abby: Tales from Bottomley Manor is a 2014 pornographic comedy film that parodies the British television series Downton Abbey. The film is the first porn parody produced by British studio Harmony Films and directed by Gazzman. The film includes an all-British cast, including Ben Dover and Lexi Lowe as the title character "Abby", and was filmed in a castle near Birmingham. Gazzman states that the local town council tried to get the shoot closed down when villagers realized what was going on at their castle, but the production wrapped successfully.
