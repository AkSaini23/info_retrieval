Carleton is a light rail station located along the Trillium Line at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario.
Carleton is currently the only O-Train station along the Trillium Line with separate tracks and platforms for each direction, in order to allow the two trains working the otherwise single-track line at any given time to pass. The schedule is timed such that the southbound train arrives first and moves onto the platform siding, and then proceeds once the northbound train has entered the station.
South of Carleton, the train crosses the Rideau River by a bridge. North of Carleton, the train heads into a tunnel under the Rideau Canal.
The station is named for nearby Carleton University.
