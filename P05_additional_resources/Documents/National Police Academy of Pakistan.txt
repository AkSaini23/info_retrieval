The National Police Academy (NPA) (Urdu: قومی پولیس اکادمی پاکستان) is the National Institute for training of the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) officers who have been selected through the Central Superior Services examination. The trained officers on passing out hold the rank of ASP (Assistant Superintendents of Police). The academy is located in Islamabad.

In 1978, Government of Pakistan took first steps towards the establishment of National Police Academy. A training facility was established at Soan Camp on the outskirts of Rawalpindi with offices in rented premises in Islamabad. Though an improvement on the previous arrangements at Police College Sihala, this arrangement also lacked important facilities which are essential for Police Training. National Police Academy was dependent upon Police College Sihala for provision of riding, firing and obstacles facilities. In addition, the distance between training and administrative wings also contributed to ineffective supervision of training activities.
Initially, ASPs were trained in Basic Courses which subsequently replaced with Initial Command Course (ICC) after 1998.
Initial Command Course (ICC) is Specialized Training Programme (STP) designed for the new entrants of Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) officers which is spread over 18 months. This training consists upon four different phases 1) Foundation; 2) Development; 3) Field Attachment & 4) Consolidation.
