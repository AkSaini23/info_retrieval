Located in a geologically active region, New Zealand has numerous geothermal features, including volcanoes, hot springs, geysers and volcanic lakes. Many of these features cluster together geographically, notably throughout the central North Island's Taupo Volcanic Zone. These areas attract scientific interest and tourism;  power generators,  industry and civil engineering also utilise them.
