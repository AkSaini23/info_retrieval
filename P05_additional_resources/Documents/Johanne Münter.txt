Johanne Elisabeth Münter née Johnson (1844–1921) was a Danish writer and women's rights activist. 
After travelling to Japan with her husband in 1895, Münter authored several books on Japanese women and her own fascination with the country. In the 1890s, she became involved in the women's movement, speaking about culture and religion at the Kvindelig Læseforening (Women's Reading Society). She also joined the Danske Kvinders Forsvarsforening (Danish Women's Defence Association) and the women's department of the Red Cross. 
In 1904, she participated in the founding conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWSA) in Berlin. In 1906, she founded and headed the women's suffrage organization Kvindevalgretsklubben which was a member of the Danske Kvindeforeningers Valgretsforbund (Danish Women's Society Suffrage Union). Münter served as a delegate at the IWSA conferences in Amsterdam (1908) and London (1909).
