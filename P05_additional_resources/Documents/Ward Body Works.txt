Ward Body Works (also known as Ward Industries and Ward School Bus Manufacturing, Inc.) was an American bus manufacturer.  Headquartered in Conway, Arkansas, Ward specialized in yellow school buses, alongside buses for other uses.  Founded in 1933 by D.H. "Dave" Ward, the company was family-owned for nearly its entire existence.
Among several innovations, Ward was the first manufacturer to perform a rollover test on a school bus, leading to changes in school bus body design.  Ward would also become the first school bus manufacturer to assemble buses on an assembly line.In 1980, Ward filed for bankruptcy and was reorganized as American Transportation Corporation (AmTran) keeping the Ward brand name in use on school buses.  In 1991, AmTran was acquired by Navistar International, with the Ward name phased out during 1992.  Today, International produces school buses using its IC Bus subsidiary (the successor to AmTran).
