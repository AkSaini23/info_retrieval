The Eastern Intercollegiate Conference (EIC) was an athletic conference in the National Collegiate Athletic Association in the United States. The conference sponsored men's college basketball and existed from 1932 to 1939, with teams in the District of Columbia, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.
The 1937–1938 conference champion, Temple, went on to win the 1938 National Invitation Tournament.Although the Associated Press described the conference as "one of the best in the nation," its members agreed to disband it at the end of the 1938–1939 season because geographical problems had made scheduling difficult.
