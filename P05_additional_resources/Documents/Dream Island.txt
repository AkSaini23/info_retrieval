Dream Island is an island lying 0.7 km (0.43 mi) south-east of Cape Monaco, off the south-west coast of Anvers Island in Wylie Bay, in the Palmer Archipelago of Antarctica. It was surveyed by the British Naval Hydrographic Survey Unit in 1956-1957 and named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee for its natural features including a cave and, in summer, a small waterfall, with mossy patches and grass.  It lies about 10 km north-west of the United States' Palmer Station.
