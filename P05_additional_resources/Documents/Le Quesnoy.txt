Le Quesnoy (French pronunciation: ​[lə kenwa]; Picard: L' Kénoé) is a commune and small town in the east of the Nord department of northern France. It was part of the historical province of French Hainaut. It had a keynote industry in shoemaking before the late 1940s, followed by a chemical factory and dairy, giving way to its weekly market, tourism, local commuting to elsewhere such as Valenciennes and local shops.
Le Quesnoy's inhabitants are known as Quercitains.
