The Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel (Spanish: Cártel de Santa Rosa de Lima) or CSRL is a Mexican criminal organization from the state of Guanajuato. Founded in 2014, it was initially headed by "The Sledgehammer". They mainly earn their income from oil theft. In June 2020, it was reported that state government raids and turf wars with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel resulted in the Santa Rosa de Lima losing much of their territories in Guanajuato, Querétaro and Hidalgo and all of their "soldiers." However, cartel members still maintain a small presence in certain municipalities of Guanajuato, such as Villagrán, though they are not active in organized crime. Ortiz was captured by state and federal authorities on 2 August 2020 along with 5 other people.
