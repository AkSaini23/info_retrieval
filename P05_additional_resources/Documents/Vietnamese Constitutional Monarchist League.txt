Vietnamese Constitutional Monarchist League (VCML; Vietnamese: Liên Minh Quân Chủ Lập Hiến Đa Nguyên Việt Nam) is a monarchist and anti-communist organization that seeks to restore the Nguyễn dynasty to the throne under a constitutional monarchy, as in Cambodia and Thailand. The VCML's position is that Emperor Bảo Đại was the last legitimate ruler of Vietnam. Bảo Đại and his children do not support the VCML or their political aspirations.
