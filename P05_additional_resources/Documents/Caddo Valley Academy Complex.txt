The Caddo Valley Academy Complex is a collection of former school buildings in Norman, Arkansas.  Set well back from Main Street (Arkansas Highway 8 near the junction of 9th Street and Smokey Hollow Road, the complex includes a two-story fieldstone main building, a smaller single-story home economics building (located down the slope northwest of the main building), both located northwest of 9th Street, and a large concrete block gym with a gabled roof, located across 9th Street from the other two.  The main school, built in 1924, is an outstanding local example of Craftsman styling; the 1937 home economics building also has Craftsman style; the gym was built in 1951, and is vernacular in style.  The school was used until the local schools were consolidated into a new facility in 1971.The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. The main school was designed by Bayard Witt of the firm Witt, Seibert & Halsey of Texarkana, Arkansas.
