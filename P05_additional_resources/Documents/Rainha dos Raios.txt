Rainha dos Raios (Queen of Lightning) is the second album by Brazilian singer Alice Caymmi, released on 9 September 2014. It is her first album via Joia Moderna and with producer Diogo Strausz. While her previous album, Alice Caymmi, consisted mostly of original songs and two covers, Rainha dos Raios does the opposite and brings covers and two original tracks. According to Caymmi, this shift came after a few changes she went through - she said she is no longer performing songs from the previous album. She commented:
It's my album, and, without trying to be a showoff, I listen to it a lot, because it says a lot about my life. I did this album thinking of what I stop to listen to, the things I like to listen to and the way I like to do it. It looks like I made the album for me. I laugh, play and remind of many moments.
In another interview, she defined the album as follows:
The rebelliousness, the punk and the rock already do that, there's nothing new, but there's the context of Brazil. My challenge is to create a strong artist aesthetic in a country difficult to interpret. A country with black and indigenous history, a colonized and suffering country. To be an artist in Brazil is almost to be an anthropologist.
Rainha dos Raios was followed by her first Brazilian tour, starting in Salvador, Bahia.About doing so many covers, she stated: "I don't like to write what I want to say, I like to use other people's words. [...] I like to sing situations that I never saw happening. It's a way of living other things".
