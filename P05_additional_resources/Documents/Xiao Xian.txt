Xiao Xian (蕭銑) (583–621) was a descendant of the imperial house of the Chinese dynasty Liang Dynasty, who rose against the rule of Sui Dynasty toward the end of the rule of Emperor Yang of Sui.  He tried to revive Liang, and for several years appeared to be successful in doing so, as he, with his capital at Jiangling, ruled over a state that included most of modern Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, and northern Vietnam.  In 621, however, under an attack by the Tang Dynasty generals Li Jing and Li Xiaogong, he, not realizing that relief forces were approaching Jiangling, surrendered.  He was subsequently taken to the Tang capital Chang'an, where Emperor Gaozu of Tang executed him.
