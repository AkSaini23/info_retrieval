The Divine Word College of San Jose is a private, Catholic, coeducational basic and higher education institution run by the Philippine Central Province of the  Society of the Divine Word or SVD in San Jose, Occidental Mindoro, Philippines. It holds the distinction of being the first and oldest educational institution in Mindoro island, even predating the island-province's separation into two provinces by five years, in 1950.Established as Southern Mindoro Academy in the middle of 1945 by Gabriel Fabrero Fabella, a lawyer and prominent historian, it offered secondary education which became exclusive to boys upon its incorporation into the Society of Divine Word (SVD) in 1960. It was renamed to Divine Word College a year after its acquisition by the SVD, and has since offered complete academic courses from basic to tertiary education and postgraduate and vocational programs. Its patron saints are St. Arnold Janssen, the founder of the Society of the Divine Word, and St. Joseph Freinademetz, a missionary priest in China.
