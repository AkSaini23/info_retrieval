Polseres vermelles (Eastern Catalan: [pulˈseɾəz βəɾˈmɛʎəs], literally "Red bracelets", known in English as The Red Band Society) is a Catalan television show, created by Albert Espinosa. He and director-producer Pau Freixas had previously worked together on the film Herois.
The show draws on Espinosa's childhood experiences, telling the story of a group of children and teenagers who meet as patients in the children's wing of a hospital.
The first season of the show, originally planned for four seasons, aired on TV3 in 2011, with a second one premiering in January 2013. The Spanish channel Antena 3 aired the first season, dubbed into Spanish as Pulseras rojas, in summer 2012 and the second one in late 2013.
In October 2011, it was announced that Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks and Marta Kauffman had reached an agreement with TV3 for an American remake of Polseres Vermelles.
In November 2013, the Fox Network announced it would be adapting the series, with Margaret Nagle from Boardwalk Empire set to write the script.
Besides the American version, the series has been adapted in other countries, as well, most notably in Italy and Germany.
