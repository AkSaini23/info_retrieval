The computational intelligence and machine learning (CIML) community portal is an international multi-university initiative.  Its primary purpose is to help facilitate a virtual scientific community infrastructure for all those involved with, or interested in, computational intelligence and machine learning.  This includes CIML research-, education, and application-oriented resources residing at the portal and others that are linked from the CIML site.
