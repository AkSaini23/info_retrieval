Liscio or ballo liscio ("smooth" or "smooth dance" respectively in Italian) is a genre of music originating in the 19th century in the northern Italian region of Romagna under the influence of Viennese ballroom dances including the mazurka, waltz, polka, schottische, march. It later became popular and spread to the rest of the country. The accordion, which was also a 19th-century invention, features prominently. The tradition contrasts with older Italian folk dances in which the fiddle was the primary instrument.
