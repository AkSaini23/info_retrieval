The Caquet√° moist forests (NT0107) is an ecoregion of tropical moist broad leaf forest to the east of the Andes in the east of Colombia, with a small section in Brazil, in the Amazon biome.
The forests are in the transition between the Guiana and Amazon regions, and have highly diverse flora and fauna.
They are relatively intact, although they are mostly unprotected and are threatened with deforestation to create cattle pastures.
