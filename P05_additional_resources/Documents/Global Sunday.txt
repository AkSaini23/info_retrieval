Global Sunday was a Canadian news magazine television program which aired Sunday evenings on the Global Television Network. The program was launched in September 2001, with Charles Adler as host. Run separately from the rest of Global's news division, the program often reflected the political views of Global's founder, Israel Asper and the Asper family, and was designed to showcase a Western Canadian perspective on Canadian political affairs.The program ran a mix of features reporting and interviews, effectively acting as a cross between a newsmagazine and an American-style Sunday talk show, and aired reportage and panel discussions featuring journalists from both Global News and the network's co-owned CanWest News Service network of newspapers.The program's launch also spurred both of Global's major rival networks, CTV and CBC, to relaunch Sunday public affairs shows. CTV, which had not produced such a program since the cancellation of Mike Duffy's Sunday Edition in 1999, relaunched its earlier show Question Period, while CBC launched CBC News: Sunday.
