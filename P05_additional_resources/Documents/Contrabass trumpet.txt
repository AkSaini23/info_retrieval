The contrabass trumpet is the lowest-pitched member of the trumpet family, sounding below the bass trumpet. A very rare novelty instrument, only a small number of instruments exist. It first appeared in the mid 20th century and has no orchestral or jazz repertoire. Usually built in 12' F a perfect fourth below the B♭ bass trumpet, it has the same length as the F contrabass trombone, cimbasso or tuba. Some (sometimes called the subcontrabass trumpet) are built larger in 18' B♭ an octave below the bass trumpet, two octaves below a standard B♭ trumpet.
