This is a historical list of all Roman Catholic bishops whose sees were on the island of Puerto Rico, with links to the bishops who consecrated them. It includes only members of the Puerto Rican Episcopal Conference and their predecessors. From its establishment in 1531 until the erection of the diocese of Ponce in 1924, the entire island was a single diocese. In 1960, the diocese of San Juan was raised to an archdiocese, and is currently the suffragan see of the five other dioceses on the island: Ponce, Arecibo, Caguas, Mayagüez, and Fajardo–Humacao.
The number references the sequence of consecration.  "Diocese" refers to the diocese over which the bishop presided or, if he did not preside, the diocese in which he served as coadjutor bishop or auxiliary bishop. The Roman numeral before the diocese name represents where in the sequence that bishop falls; e.g., the fourth bishop of Arecibo is written "IV Arecibo." Where a diocese is in bold type it indicates that the bishop is the current bishop of that diocese. Titular sees are not listed. Under consecrators are the numbers (or letters) referencing previous bishops on the list. The number listed first represents the principal consecrator. If a series of letters is under "Consecrators," then the consecrators were bishops from outside Puerto Rico (the list of foreign sees is at the bottom of the page).
