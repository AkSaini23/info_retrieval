Savage Vengeance is a 1993 American rape and revenge film written and directed by Donald Farmer.
It stars Camille Keaton (under the alias "Vickie Kehl") as Jennifer, a reference to Keaton's earlier role as Jennifer Hills in I Spit on Your Grave. For this reason the film is often considered an unofficial sequel to that film.
