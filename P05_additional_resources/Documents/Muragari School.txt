Muragari Primary School is the third-oldest school in Embu, Kenya. It was founded 1932 by the National Independent Church of Africa near the current Mukuuri Township, Kagaari North Ward, Runyenjes Sub County.
It was razed by colonialists in 1952 during the Mau Mau Uprising in Embu.
Muragari was rebuilt in 1955 on 24 acres as a government school, at the site where General Kubu Kubu was cremated after being shot dead by colonial officers.
Muragari now comprises a day primary school, Muragari Secondary School and Kubu Kubu Memorial Boarding Primary School in memory of General Kubu Kubu.
