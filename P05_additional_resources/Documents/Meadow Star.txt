Meadow Star (May 19, 1988 â€“ April 11, 2002) was an American Thoroughbred Champion racehorse.  She was described by Breeders' Cup Inc. as "one of the greatest 2-year-old fillies ever".
Foaled in Florida, Meadow Star was bred by Jaime Carrion at his The Oaks farm in Ocala. Sired by the American Grade I winner Meadowlake, and out of the mare Inreality Star, she was sold at the 1989 Keeneland yearling sale for $90,000. Her buyer, prominent Wall Street investor Carl Icahn, handed her over to trainer LeRoy Jolley for race conditioning.
