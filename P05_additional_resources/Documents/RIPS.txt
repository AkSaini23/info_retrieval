RIPS (Research and Innovation to Promote Security) is a static code analysis software for the automated detection of security vulnerabilities in PHP and Java applications. The initial tool was written by Johannes Dahse and released during the Month of PHP Security in May 2010 as open-source software. The open-source version is released under the Lesser GNU General Public License and was maintained until 2013.
IIn 2016, a new and rewritten version of RIPS was released as a software product by RIPS Technologies, a high-tech company based in Bochum, Germany. The new RIPS product overcomes the limitations of the open-source tool and addresses industrial needs. Its novel analysis techniques were awarded, amongst others, the Internet Defense Prize by Facebook.
In 2020, RIPS Technologies was acquired by SonarSource. The RIPS tool is no longer available as a stand-alone product.
