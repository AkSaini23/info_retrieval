The Young Offenders is a coming-of-age sitcom, developed by Peter Foott. Adapted from the 2016 film of the same title, the programme began broadcasting through RTÃ‰2 in Ireland and BBC Three in the United Kingdom (all episodes are available for streaming via BBC iPlayer). The series follows the troubled lives of "lovable rogues" Conor MacSweeney (Alex Murphy) and Jock O'Keefe (Chris Walley).
The first series was broadcast between 1 February and 8 March 2018, consisting of 6 episodes. A Christmas special followed, which was released on 14 December of the same year. The success of the first series led to a second being commissioned, which aired for another 6 episodes, all episodes being available for streaming on 3 November 2019, though broadcast in Ireland weekly, until 8 December.
