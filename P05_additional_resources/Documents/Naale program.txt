Naale Elite Academy (Hebrew: נעל"ה) is an international program that enables Jewish teenagers from the diaspora to study and complete their high school education in Israel for free. It was founded in 1992 in a joint effort with the Jewish Agency.
The program brings Jewish teenagers worldwide to study for three or four years in a number of designated Israeli high schools which enroll regular students from the surrounding area, but also have Naale dormitories on their premises or within a walking distance (the latter usually in a moshav) and which employ specialized Hebrew language teachers to handle Naale program students.
There are two academic tracks available - regular (choice of a secular or religious school, 3 or 4 years) and advanced (the Anieres program - secular, 4 years).
