The Siracusa lemon (in Italian, Limone di Siracusa IGP) is the fruit of the cultivar "femminello" and its clones, corresponding to the botanical species Citrus x limon L. Burm. The femminello cultivar from Siracusa is the most common variety of lemon in Italy, and produces three main flowerings: the primofiore (from October 1), the bianchetto (also less commonly known as the maiolino, from April 15) and the verdello (or summer lemon, from July 1). The Disciplinary regulations of the Siracusa Lemon (PGI) forbids the use of waxes and/or fungicides in post-harvesting, and therefore the fruit is edible in all its parts.
