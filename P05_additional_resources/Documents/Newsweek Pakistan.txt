Newsweek Pakistan is published by AG Publications, a company wholly owned by Associated Group (AG), under license from Newsweek LLC. The licensing agreement with AG Publications follows similar publishing alliances for Newsweek editions. Newsweek's Asia Pacific edition, published in Hong Kong, has been available in Pakistan for over 50 years. Newsweek Pakistan replaced the Asia Pacific edition, and carries reportage, analysis and opinion on Pakistan in addition to the content featured in the international edition. The Pakistan edition draws upon both its own editorial staff and Newsweek's international network of correspondents.
Fasih Ahmed, who has reported for the Wall Street Journal, Newsweek and The Daily Beast, is the editor of Newsweek Pakistan. Ahmed won a New York Press Club award in 2008 for Newsweekâ€™s coverage of the assassination of former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto.
