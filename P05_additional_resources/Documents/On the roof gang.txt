The On the Roof Gang (sometimes written On-the-Roof-Gang and abbreviated OTRG) was a group of United States Navy cryptologists and radiomen during World War II who are seen as the forerunners of U.S. Navy cryptology and cryptanalysis. One hundred fifty Sailors and 26 Marines worked on the roof of the Navy Department building in Washington, D.C. from 1928 to 1941.
