The Brigade Speciale Beveiligingsopdrachten (BSB) (English: Special Security Missions Brigade) is the elite police tactical unit of the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee. Its missions include counter-terrorism, protection of government and military officials, and targeting organised crime.
Like many other European police tactical units, the BSB was established in 1975 following Munich massacre. While the BSB conducts special operations, its missions are not planned by the Netherlands Special Operations Command (NLD SOCOM).
