The Swiss Alcohol Board (SAB) is a federal authority of the Swiss Confederation.
The SAB is responsible for the enforcement of the Swiss Alcohol Act, which governs the production and importation of spirits and ethanol, as well as trade in and advertising of spirits. The aim of this legislation is health protection (Art. 105 of the Swiss Federal Constitution). Fermented beverages, such as wine and beer, are not included in the scope of application of the Alcohol Act.
